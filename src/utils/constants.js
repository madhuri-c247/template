Our experience covers alltypes of routing: high density routing (waste collection, postaldeliveries, snow plow routing, newspaper deliveries, meter reading),point-to-point routing (collections, deliveries and sales forces withless than 200 stops per route per day), and paired routing(para-transit, armored car and similar). We take pride in ourinnovations in waste collections and routing. We recently pioneeredthe development of key performance indicators for waste collectionoperations. See our new training presentation, Key PerformanceIndicators in Waste Collections Routing , conducted for the SolidWaste Association of North America, June 23, 2021.";
